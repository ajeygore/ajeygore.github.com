Our vision is to help startups by providing world class scalable, fault tolerant and highly available

I love working with variety of technologies and tools, I have worked in various languages, frameworks and tools. Now a days I primarily work with Ruby, Go, JavaScript and related frameworks.
I also work with mobile development environments such as iOS and Android. I play with swift, java, objective c.

Apart from languages, my interests include virtualisation, network management and infrastructure management. I have been using containers, virtualisation platforms and configuration management tools such as
