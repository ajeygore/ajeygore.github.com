I live in [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore) and work at [gojek](https://gojek.com), I grew up in a small town in northern India, studies in Allahabad & Bangalore. 
My company, [CodeIgnition](https://twitter.com/codeignition), along with [C42](https://twitter.com/c42engineering) got acquihired by gojek in late 2015. And [Leftshift](https://twitter.com/leftshifters) joined us in following year. 

I believe in **Earn people, not money** and I am fortunate to have so many friends and true well wishers.
