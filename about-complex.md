        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <p class="lead">I'm a software engineer who believes technology should serve people, not the other way around.</p>

            <p>Born in India, I've lived across continents — Bangalore, London, Chicago, Jakarta, and now Singapore. My path into technology wasn't straight. I started in commerce and arts, worked as a graphics designer, sold computers, ran a printing press, and helped my brother with his mobile phone business. Every detour taught me something about people, business, and building things that matter.</p>

            <p>I've spent the last two decades writing software, building teams, and helping organisations grow. At heart, I'm still the curious person who wants to understand how things work and why people do what they do.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- What I've Done -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">Work</h3>

            <p>I'm a software engineer at heart, but my work has always extended beyond code — building teams, mentoring leaders, and helping organisations scale technology and culture together.</p>

            <p>Most recently, I was Operating Partner (Technology) at <strong>PeakXV Partners</strong> (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA), working with CTOs and founders across the portfolio. That chapter concluded in January 2026.</p>

            <p>Before PeakXV, I served as Group CTO at <strong>Gojek</strong>, scaling a startup from a handful of engineers to over 2,000 people across multiple countries. Before that, a decade at <strong>ThoughtWorks</strong> — starting as their first India office employee and eventually leading technology for the India region.</p>

            <p>Right now, I'm in a quieter season. I'm advising selectively, working with <a href="https://helloally.ai" target="_blank">Ally</a> (a not-for-profit focused on mental health), and exploring ideas that genuinely spark something. I haven't mapped out what's next, and that feels good.</p>

        <!-- Philosophy -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">Philosophy</h3>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                "I carry a small collection of successes and a large library of failures. The failures teach me more."
            </blockquote>

            <p>I believe in intellectual honesty above all else. My perspectives are shaped by experience, which means they're inherently biased and potentially incomplete. I welcome being corrected — it's how I learn.</p>

            <p>Three principles guide my work: <strong>People first</strong> — technology serves people, not quarterly reports. <strong>Embrace "I don't know"</strong> — those three words have opened more doors than any certification. <strong>Simple wins</strong> — complexity is usually just poorly understood simplicity.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Working with me -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">Working with me</h3>

            <p>I'm a converted extrovert — I process through conversation but also need time to think. I prefer direct communication. Tell me what you think, disagree when you disagree, don't worry about being diplomatic. I can separate professional discussions from personal relationships.</p>

            <p>Come with problems and proposed solutions. Share your opinion before asking for mine. Be patient with my questions — I ask a lot of them. And don't take my strong opinions personally; they're held lightly and change with new evidence.</p>

            <p>I don't schedule many one-on-ones, but I'm always available for impromptu conversations. If you need to talk, just reach out.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- What drives me -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">What drives me</h3>

            <p>Complex problems at the intersection of technology, people, and business. I believe in transparency over diplomacy, simple solutions over clever ones, and action over analysis. Organisations should evolve with their products — the art is knowing when and how to change.</p>

            <p>At the end of the day, I'm someone who enjoys learning, building things that matter, and working with people who care about their craft.</p>
