#### Namaste!

```
/ˈnʌməsteɪ/

  a respectful greeting 
  said with hands joined together!
```

__Note__: This is updated version of my manual. For the old version, you can read it [here](/readme-gojek)

Namaste! I&#39;m Ajey. I was born in Banda, India, a very small town in northern india, grew up there. My studies took me to Allahabad and Bangalore. 
In the last 25 years, I had setup my own printing business, self learned programming, professionally learned accounting,
lived in Bangalore, London, Chicago, Pune, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and now live between Singapore, Jakarta and Bangalore.
I started my career as a graphics designer, then later ended up writing software for last 25 years. I love to play strategy games (Age of empires, Civilization, Chess) and draw/paint. Recently I stated to draw again.


I borrowed many ideas from [Abhinit](https://twitter.com/abhinitial){:target="_blank"} 
and [Sidu](https://twitter.com/ponnappa){:target="_blank"} for writing this manual, and here it is.

So this page is about "how to deal with me" as person. because I fundamentally believe that everyone else is right about me
and dealing with me is constant expectation mismatch and a cage fight in a very interesting way.

## What do I do? 

I&#39;m a Software Engineer at the core, My first principle is that **I work for people and people work with me** 
which results into me talking to many people.
I see myself as swiss knife in tactical situations and an empowerment advocate in strategic terms. 
I have played various roles in my life and recently at GoJek, now I work with Sequoia Capital as Technology Partner.

In my role, I will work with the CTOs and CPOs of Sequoia’s portfolio companies to provide insight and expertise in building and scaling engineering, data science, product, and design functions.

I am sure the perspectives I am trying to put you through and context I am trying to give you are my side of stories and perception.
They might be wrong - because one side of the story is never true, since it&#39;s based on human perception, but you are welcome to correct me. 
Because I know that **&quot;Saying I don&#39;t know, and accepting the mistakes&quot;** are two most important traits to be a good colleague.

You can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ajeygore){:target="_blank"}

My responsiveness in decreasing order if you work at [Sequoia](http://sequoiacap.com/){:target="_blank"} : Whatsapp, Email, Slack, Telegram

if you want to talk to me or communicate to me publicly then reaching through twitter works for now. :-)

#### Best Way to Communicate with Me

I am converted extrovert, so I sometimes put perceived information through my introverted lense, that means, sometimes I see what I want to see, 
so I try to confirm with people on what I perceive, the way I want you to tell me what you think is walk up to me and tell me what you feel.

I keep my professional life within the confines of office premise, that means that we can argue, agree to disagree, 
but still can have an amazing dinner! I don&#39;t bring official matters to any personal meetings or outings.

I don&#39;t initiate one on one conversations, just because I run out of time, 
in turn I am perceived as one of the most difficult people to get time from, 
but if you really want to talk to me, just call me! I almost immediately respond to calls, 
because I know you will call me only if it&#39;s urgent. 
Sending me an email has response time ETA upto a week. 
I have gotten feedback that I am difficult to reach over the years, but here you go with my secret to reachability.

So I&#39;m ok with being engaged however **you** are comfortable. Take as long as you need to. Use many words or few. Use chat, email or call me or meet me in person. Whatever works for you. I&#39;ll adjust, and won&#39;t judge.

**Finally, I have strong opinions that I strive to hold as long as I am shown better ways, so I&#39;m always easiest to persuade with logic and always ready to learn, I always look for traits in people who come with problem &amp; solutions with it, always give me options to choose from and always tell their opinions on something before seeking mine.**


#### My Work Style

I really enjoy working on complex strategic product problems involving software engineering, design, data science or scaling. 

I have a strong interest in software design, team building and how they work with org design.

I believe that the way product evolves over a period of time, organisation should evolve as well. 

I have always followed John Ousterhaut and now he has a book around the same topic, 
please read [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201){:target="_blank"} by John Ousterhaut. 

I prefer being reasonable and transparent. I encourage transparency in general -
especially around [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication)
When you ask me a question, I will always ask you the context for the question,
that helps give you more elaborate and explainable answers. I also prefer egalitarian meritocracy. 
As a consequence I work more effectively with people with whom I can

#### How I Think I Evaluate People

Evaluating performance is often the largest part of a leaders&#39; responsibilities.

I don&#39;t like anyone being judgemental. I don&#39;t like biased or judgemental views, 
I don&#39;t like people forming opinions about others based on few events or the way they behave.
I believe in long term and transparent professional relationships, that means, you will find me very unbiased or aloof towards people. 
and I am working on reducing the bias in my own evaluation of any given person;
I make a conscious effort to avoid forming an opinion based on what a handful of people tell me about someone.

I&#39;m not great at this, and am always open to feedback. 
Here&#39;s a list of my people related biases I think matter most.

###### **I am positively-biased toward:**

- people who see their work as creativity and recognise that they need constant improvement.
- people who believe that what they do is a craft and they keep honing their skills around that.
- people who dedicate a lot of time deeply caring about other people and their professional success
- people who demonstrate clarity of purpose. (they always have a crisp answer to &quot;what do you want to make happen?&quot;)
- people who I see accepting accountability for creating outcomes. (reverse spiderman rule: to those with great responsibility give great power)
- people who consistently create outcomes they signed up for
- people who visibly make their colleagues better at their jobs by teaching them their own skills. (these people are superb team builders)
- people who argue to find the right answer rather than to win.
- people who work regardless of who gets the credit for that work.
- people who are curious and ready to learn all the time
- people who see success are of the team and failure for themselves

###### **I am negatively-biased against:**

- people without skin flesh in the game that want a say.
- people who use appeals to authority instead of reason in their arguments.
- people who cause drama.
- people who don&#39;t study and iterate but want to be treated as if they do.
