One day Simon Wardley's Heroku hosted Strategy Generator went out of action. The strategy generator is a pun on many stratbros who come in
as strategic advisor and come up with something that seems very reasonable and extremely convincing.

So here is machine, helping you with that. Click on button below to get a strategy for your company, and if you don't like it, press the button again.
This button generators random convincingly appropriate strategy.

On top of that, I have wrote a prompt engineered strategy to be used with Chat GPT3, you can copy this prompt and use as input for ChatGPT and it will give you an eleaborate strategy.

PS: This was a 2 hours fun with JavaScript.
