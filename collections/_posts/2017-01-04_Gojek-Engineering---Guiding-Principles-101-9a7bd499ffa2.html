While it is extremely rewarding, it is also challenging. This is because we often work on tough problems with no clear solutionâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhich involves taking risks and learning things on the fly.</p><blockquote name="0006" id="0006" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">All this, while competing with the best in the industry.</blockquote><p name="34fc" id="34fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Thatâ€™s why our guiding principles serve as a great reference point to deal with situations that arise every day. Here are some that we abide by:</p><p name="e843" id="e843" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Everyone writes codeâ€Šâ€”â€Š</strong>At Gojek, we believe that Software Principals/Architects/Engineers can only do the right thing when they work on code themselves. Itâ€™s the only way to decide whatâ€™s working and whatâ€™s not. We donâ€™t believe that software requires a 50,000 foot overview with people exclusively working on the blueprint. At Gojek, writing software is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">not</strong> a low-level task; itâ€™s at the very core of what we do.</p><blockquote name="6c60" id="6c60" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Leaders who code are better judges of technical skill.</blockquote><p name="fd06" id="fd06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Everyone needs to â€˜walk the talkâ€™â€Šâ€”â€Š</strong>We respect people who get down in the trenches and take a hands-on approach to problem solving. Based on our experience, standing at a distance and issuing commandments has many a time been inefficient and error prone, and hence we avoid this.</p><p name="f597" id="f597" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Leaders are grown and not made</strong>â€Šâ€”â€ŠWe believe in acquired respect and leadership, not leadership by position. At Gojek, you earn your leadership mettle. We believe in helping our people grow into leadership roles by giving them chances, risk appetite and freedom. We trust our people and support them to do the right thing at any given moment. In my own career, Iâ€™ve been privileged enough to have found some amazing mentors, and I am glad to be able to continue the legacy at Gojek.</p><p name="8603" id="8603" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Every decision is correct at the time it is made</strong>â€Šâ€”â€ŠSwift decision-making is extremely important in a fast paced environment like ours. Once a decision is made, we donâ€™t constantly agonise over it or second guess. We trust that whenever someone makes a decision, it is the right one, given the information available to them at that time. Only the passage of time can tell us whether a particular decision was right or wrong. Itâ€™s OK to change decisions, and we encourage people to not be afraid to make a decision.</p><p name="bad5" id="bad5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Every person has some strengths, even if we donâ€™t always see them</strong>â€Šâ€”â€ŠA great team is built with a group of people who have complementary skill sets. A combination of different strengths make teams that can tackle all kinds of situations. At Gojek, we believe each one of us is unique and has unique strengths. Itâ€™s just a matter of finding the right role to match the skills. Teams become super strong when they appreciate each otherâ€™s strengths.</p><p name="4c70" id="4c70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Working in tech means learning all the time</strong>â€Šâ€”â€ŠLearning is important in every field. In the technology industry, it is a matter of life and death. Technology is changing all the time, what worked a decade ago may be completely obsolete now. For example, practices that worked in Waterfall donâ€™t work in Agile, and user experiences on mobile apps were unimaginable a few years back. So, we constantly look for and admire people who are curious and willing to learn.</p><blockquote name="ac7a" id="ac7a" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">The best part? Such people will always hire people they can learnÂ from!</blockquote><p name="c5b1" id="c5b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pair Programming and Test-Driven Development (TDD) workâ€Š</strong>â€”â€ŠIf they didnâ€™t, our teams wouldnâ€™t exist. Wherever we have followed this, we found our teamâ€™s job on supporting software is more around features than bugs! We have experienced over decades that this helps us build features faster, and mature teams organically. The bottom line isÂ : to write beautiful code, we believe there is no better way than rigorous pair programming and practising TDD.</p></div></div></section><section name="b7e9" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="75b8" id="75b8" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Working with a vibrant bunch of highly motivated, intelligent people isnâ€™t always easy, but it is worth it.
