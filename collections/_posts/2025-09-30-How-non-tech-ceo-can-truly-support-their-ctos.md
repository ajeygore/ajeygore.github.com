A founder once asked me, almost in a whisper: **“I’m not technical… so how do I really add value for my CTO?”**

I often get similar theme questions by non-technical founders and CEOs: "How do I really add value for my CTO? I'm not technical, so what role can I play beyond approving budgets or asking for updates?"

It’s a question I’ve heard many times, and it always makes me pause. Because hidden inside it is a mix of insecurity and curiosity — the sense that maybe, as a CEO, you’re missing something essential if you don’t know how to read code or design a system. And yet, the irony is, many of the best CEO–CTO partnerships I’ve seen had nothing to do with shared technical depth. They thrived because of alignment, trust, and a shared understanding of roles.

Too many relationships between CEOs and CTOs collapse into one of two traps. On one side, the CEO becomes completely hands-off, treating the CTO like a mechanic: “Here’s the car, make sure it runs, don’t bother me with the details.” On the other side, the CEO morphs into a backseat driver, nervously second-guessing every turn, every gear shift, every adjustment — without actually knowing how the engine works. Both approaches are doomed. One isolates the CTO, leaving them without context. The other suffocates them with interference. Neither builds trust.

The truth is, as a non-technical CEO, you don’t need to be under the hood with a wrench. Your role is to chart the route and define the destination. You set the “why” — why we’re building, why speed matters, why resilience matters, why costs matter. If your CTO has the clarity of destination, they will figure out the “how.” You don’t need to argue about whether the car should have a hybrid engine or a V8. What you should care about is: does it run reliably, will it get us there fast enough, and will the fuel bill bankrupt us on the way?

This is the first piece of advice I give to non-technical CEOs: your value lies in giving clarity of purpose, not in policing the tools. The CTO who knows where they’re headed will make far better decisions than the one forced to take directions from someone who doesn’t speak the language of engineering.

The second role you play is that of the bridge — or if you prefer, the translator. A CTO is usually fantastic at building systems, designing architectures, and making sure technology works. But translating all that into a language that resonates with investors, board members, or customers? That’s often where they need you. You are the captain on the deck; they are the engineer in the engine room. Without you, the board might never know how much strain the engines are under. Without them, you’d be steering a ship with no power. You’re both essential, but in different ways.

This bridging role can’t be overstated. When a CTO says, “We need to refactor,” most outsiders hear “nerds tinkering.” But when you step in and explain it as, “We’re lowering future costs and ensuring the product doesn’t break under growth,” suddenly it lands. You’re taking their technical music and orchestrating it for the audience. They’re tuning the instruments; you’re making sure the hall hears a symphony, not just noise.

Now let’s talk about growth. Too often, CTOs get stuck as firefighters — the people who are always putting out blazes. A database crashes, a deploy fails, a server misbehaves — and they’re there with a bucket of water. That can’t be their whole career. If you want to add value as a CEO, don’t just thank them for dousing the flames. Encourage them to install sprinklers, fire exits, and a proper safety system. Support them when they say, “We need more people,” or, “We need to pause and build resilience before we add more features.” Let them grow into builders of teams and systems, not just responders to crises.

Recognition matters too. Much of a CTO’s work happens behind the curtain. When sales close a big deal, the world notices. When product launches, the team celebrates. But when the system scales smoothly under a sudden 10x traffic spike? Often silence. As a CEO, you can change that. Shine a light on their contributions. Public recognition goes a long way in reinforcing that their role is more than invisible plumbing; it’s the backbone of your company’s future.

And then comes candor. The strongest CEO–CTO relationships I’ve seen are those built on the ability to tell each other uncomfortable truths. A CTO must feel safe to say, “This won’t scale; we need to slow down and fix it,” even if it disrupts the roadmap. And a CEO must feel free to say, “This is over-engineered; we need something simpler to test the market,” even if it means cutting corners. Neither is right all the time. But both voices are necessary. Without candor, you risk building castles in the sky or, worse, setting fire to the engine mid-voyage.

So, if you’re a non-tech CEO, here’s what I want you to remember: stop worrying about whether you understand enough technology. That’s not your role. Your CTO doesn’t need you to be an engineer. They need you to be a partner. Give them clarity of destination, connect their work to the larger business story, invest in their growth, recognize their wins, and create a culture of candor. They’ll handle the code, the wiring, the systems. Together, you’ll handle the company.



**In summary**, here are the four key ways non-technical CEOs can truly support their CTOs: **Provide clarity** about business goals, priorities, and success metrics so they can make aligned technical decisions. **Act as a bridge** by translating their technical work into business outcomes and protecting their focus from distractions. **Invest in their growth** by supporting hiring, delegation, and leadership development while recognizing their contributions publicly. **Build trust** through candid communication where both sides can share hard truths without fear. Remember, your CTO doesn't need you to understand code—they need you to be a strategic partner who enables them to do their best work.

**Your CTO isn’t just there to keep the lights on. They are your co-pilot in building the future. Treat them like a partner on the bridge, not a mechanic in the basement. Do that, and you’ll both win.**
