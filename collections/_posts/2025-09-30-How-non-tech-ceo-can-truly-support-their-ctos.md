I often get asked by non-technical founders and CEOs: "How do I really add value for my CTO? I'm not technical, so what role can I play beyond approving budgets or asking for updates?"

It's a good question. And an important one. Too many times, I've seen this relationship either collapse into complete detachment — where the CEO just assumes the CTO will "make tech work" and doesn't engage at all — or the opposite extreme, where the CEO constantly micromanages and gets lost in the weeds of tools, frameworks, and architecture choices. Both extremes are harmful. One leaves the CTO isolated without context. The other suffocates them with interference. Neither builds trust or unlocks the true potential of the partnership.

Here's the thing: as a CEO, you don't need to know more tech than your CTO. That's not your job. Your job is to give them clarity. Clarity about the company's goals, priorities, and constraints. If they understand the "why," they'll figure out the "how." If they know what success looks like — whether that's speed to market, rock-solid reliability, security you can take to an investor meeting, or efficiency to keep cloud bills under control — they can make the technical calls that line up with business needs. The more business context you give, the better decisions they'll make.

And then there's the role of being a bridge. CTOs are brilliant at design, architecture, and code, but not all of them are natural storytellers when it comes to translating technology into boardroom or investor language. That's where you add huge value. You can help frame their work in business outcomes. You can stand next to them and explain why that shift to a new architecture isn't just a technical exercise, but a way to serve customers better or scale more efficiently. You can protect their time by filtering distractions, so they focus on what matters most. Think of it this way: they own the "engine," but you help connect it to the "dashboard" everyone else sees.

Another piece is investment. Too many CEOs treat their CTOs as permanent firefighters — the person who puts out every blaze, fixes every outage, and answers every question. That's not sustainable. If you want to add value, encourage them to grow as leaders. Support them when they say they need to hire or delegate. Push them to step out of execution-only mode and into shaping the team, culture, and future of technology inside your company. Recognize their impact publicly, because being a CTO can often feel invisible compared to sales or product leaders who are constantly in the spotlight. That recognition goes a long way.

And finally, create a space for candor. The best relationships between CEOs and CTOs are built on trust — the ability to tell each other hard truths without fear. You need a CTO who can say, "This won't scale, we have to slow down and fix it," even if that's not what you want to hear. And they need a CEO who can say, "I think we're over-engineering this; we need to be pragmatic right now," without undermining their expertise. That push and pull, when it's rooted in respect, is how you get balance between innovation and execution.

So, if you're a non-technical CEO, here's my advice: stop worrying about whether you "understand enough tech." That's not the game. Your CTO doesn't need you to be an engineer. They need you to be a partner. Give them clarity of purpose, act as their bridge to the business, invest in their leadership, and build a foundation of trust. They'll take care of the code, the systems, and the architecture. Together, you'll take care of the company.

**In summary**, here are the four key ways non-technical CEOs can truly support their CTOs: **Provide clarity** about business goals, priorities, and success metrics so they can make aligned technical decisions. **Act as a bridge** by translating their technical work into business outcomes and protecting their focus from distractions. **Invest in their growth** by supporting hiring, delegation, and leadership development while recognizing their contributions publicly. **Build trust** through candid communication where both sides can share hard truths without fear. Remember, your CTO doesn't need you to understand code—they need you to be a strategic partner who enables them to do their best work.

Your CTO isn't just there to keep the lights on. They're a co-creator of the future you're building. Treat them that way, and you'll both win.
