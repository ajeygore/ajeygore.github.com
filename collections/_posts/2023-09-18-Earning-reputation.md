Reputation is about what you do - do it well, or do it badly, you earn reputation around that. 

In my view, there are few obvious things you can do about earning good reputation in tech field. 

* Figure out what are you good at? or want to be good at. Tech is such a vast field that you can't talk about everything here. And really do not talk about it.
* What ever you are good at or passionate about, start talking about it to people.
* Help unconditionally - within your team and most importantly at community level.
* Start contributing to community in the ways like opensource, arranging for meetups, blogs etc. ie, I care about software engineering and I constantly not only talk about it, but laos I am willing to help others.
* Go learn - from people, network with people within your company.
* Actively volunteer to solve problems around your domain.

And lastly, reflect and adjust as you go, no one is perfect and tech field is always about learning something everyday.
