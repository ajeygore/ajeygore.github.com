Time for self appraisal, the time I dread, because I need to write self appraisal, and I really find myself in a fix, my self-critical attitude
tells me that you did what you were supposed to do, and you did not do anything extra ordinary, so why? And what do you write in self appraisal?

> Embracing Self-Appraisal with a balanced approach might be daunting task for many of us. It certainly is for me.

Let's face it: self-appraisal can feel awkward. Boasting about our achievements can seem like bragging, 
making many of us uncomfortable. But, whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned professional, 
self-appraisal is a crucial part of professional growth and recognition. 

So, how do you balance humility with the need to showcase your accomplishments? Here are some strategies:

1. ###### Journaling for Reflection and Evidence
   Daily Journaling: Start with a simple habit - daily journaling. This isn't just about listing what you did; it's about reflecting on your experiences, challenges, and learnings. Tools like Logseq or Roam Research can be incredibly helpful. They allow you to organize your thoughts and achievements in an interconnected web, making it easier to see your growth over time.
   Documenting Achievements: Use your journal to document your achievements. When you make a habit of recording your successes, no matter how small, you create a reservoir of evidence that you can draw from during your self-appraisal.
2. ##### Acknowledging All Contributions
   Value Every Contribution: Whether your contribution is big or small, acknowledge it. Every piece of work, every effort, every small win contributes to the larger picture. By valuing your own contributions, you're not bragging; you're simply stating facts.
   Concrete Examples: When you talk about your achievements, be specific. Instead of saying, "I contributed significantly to project X," say, "I developed a specific feature in project X that improved performance by Y%." This specificity doesn't just avoid the air of bragging; it clearly demonstrates your impact.
3. ##### Giving Credit: A Team Effort
   It's always a team effort whether you have an immediate team or not. Always give credit to your team. Recognize the collective effort. It's "we" and not "me". You need to value power of collaboration and understand the importance of teamwork.
   When working solo it's gets tought, but acknowledge the support and inspiration you've received from others. This could be mentors, peers, or even juniors. This demonstrates humility and gratitude.
4. ##### Balance and Honesty: 
   Be honest and balanced in how you present your contributions. If there were challenges or failures, mention them along with what you learned. The integrity and a willingness to grow is one of the most important qualities of professional journey.


> Self-Appraisal is a story of your own growth, and you need to tell that story to yourself first then to others, and it's not bragging if it's based on facts and shared with humility and gratitude. 
Gratitude towards team, because they made you what you are, graitutde towards organisation because they believe in you. So it's about
telling people how you have grown, and how you have helped others grow, and how you have helped organisation grow and vice versa.
      
Finally do not think that self-appraisal is adreaded task or feel like boasting. By regularly journaling, acknowledging all contributions, giving credit where it's due, and clearly stating your achievements, 
you create a balanced and honest self-appraisal. 

And it's not bragging if it's based on facts and shared with humility and gratitude. And that's how your professional growth and recognition will be.
