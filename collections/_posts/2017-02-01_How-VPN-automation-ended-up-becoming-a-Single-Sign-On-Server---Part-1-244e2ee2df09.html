For us, this was a great lesson on how putting small hacks together to make sure things work, and later abstracting them out to a broader product can make our life easier.</p><p name="cbbb" id="cbbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We started with trying to find a good way to restrict network access to valid users in a secure and effective fashion.</p><p name="59cf" id="59cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In most work environments, restricting access to a network is usually achieved using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">jump boxes</a>, which are basically special-purpose computers on a network, typically used to manage devices in a separate security zone. A more sophisticated approach to handle this is to use an enterprise VPN with a radius server backed by a LDAP server. While a jump box seemed like an obvious solution, there were still a few issues:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="f7c5" id="f7c5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The jump box was still an open server for everyone to attack.</li><li name="3c96" id="3c96" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We needed to create everyone’s login on jump boxes on a regular basis.</li><li name="ba83" id="ba83" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We still had to open our internal web portals to public access.</li></ol><p name="75b5" id="75b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Given these problems and seeking a simple solution, we resorted to an OpenVPN Server. This worked out great up to a point, but soon we ran into another issue — we had 1200+ employees who needed several access types, and we had to go about creating VPN profiles for each of them. We had solved problem statement (1), but (2) and (3) were still pending.</p><p name="6156" id="6156" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We also needed to deal with user management on OpenVPN server as well as user management across the organization for all of our users.</p><p name="f347" id="f347" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During this time, our DevOps team was flooded with manual tasks, as requests kept pouring in. To address this, they started creating <a href="http://rundeck.org/" data-href="http://rundeck.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RunDeck</a> jobs to automate several things including VPN profile creation. While our problem was not solved completely, the problem statement evolved a bit. Our task was clear:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="6fb3" id="6fb3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Create a self-service page for signup to VPN</li><li name="6dfe" id="6dfe" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Provide authentication, but avoid weak passwords</li><li name="d48b" id="d48b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Centrally manage all authorisation and access</li></ol><p name="0645" id="0645" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Creating self-serving service enterprise access was a big task. But we managed to find a fairly simple solution to this. The rule was, “If you have a Go-Jek email address, then you are authorized to access our servers, environments and portals in some way.”</p><h4 name="0b51" id="0b51" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">OpenVPN with self sign up and MFA</h4><p name="2a7b" id="2a7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Based on the above rule, we quickly setup a service, which upon login, redirects users to our enterprise <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Google Apps for Work</strong> OAuth page. Once that page authenticates the users, then we do following:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="c47c" id="c47c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Automatically create a VPN profile for the user behind the scene</li><li name="5119" id="5119" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Generate a Google MFA TOTP string</li><li name="3487" id="3487" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Present the user with a QR code to scan and add a Google MFA profile</li><li name="605c" id="605c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Set them up as a valid user in system</li></ul><p name="abfa" id="abfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Once they pass through these steps, users are presented with instructions to download VPN profile and can authenticate against our OpenVPN server, as shown in these images below.</p><figure name="dd10" id="dd10" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*YXgcVATcWFG029ffybamQA.png" data-width="274" data-height="206" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YXgcVATcWFG029ffybamQA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">OAuth Login</figcaption></figure><p name="2bcf" id="2bcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The first image shows an OAuth sign on page. Once users sign in, we complete following steps one by one:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="7dae" id="7dae" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Check if we have a new user; if yes, create a new user in our system</li><li name="bf57" id="bf57" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Create a TOTP string for the new user and present them with a QR code when rendering the page</li></ol><figure name="bfa9" id="bfa9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aDxxMLxcP-U1YIZ6W_tJLA.png" data-width="359" data-height="269" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aDxxMLxcP-U1YIZ6W_tJLA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Gate SSO</figcaption></figure><p name="8ae8" id="8ae8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Once equipped with these three pieces of information, we present a page to the user to download their VPN profile and setup MFA. We called our little system <a href="https://github.com/gate-sso/gate" data-href="https://github.com/gate-sso/gate" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gate SSO</a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">.</strong></p><p name="7583" id="7583" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once equipped with these three pieces of information, we present a page to the user to download their VPN profile and setup MFA.

It worked great because we could disable a user from the Gate’s administration UI. Also, since this gave users a token that changes every minute, they didn’t have to comply with complex passwords. We also limited login attempts per hour to 15, so that no one could brute force it. It’s still technically possible, but with chances as low as 15 out of 99999 combinations, the security risk is limited. Even so, we later moved to a pin + token model, which makes it even harder.</p><p name="ec2b" id="ec2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was great user experience because our OpenVPN server was now able to authenticate with our rest based Gate service by hitting a URL with username and MFA token.</p><p name="59df" id="59df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While this made life much easier, it still did not solve the problem for users accessing our portals, they were still clunky and everyone could access them. Since we had worked with JaSig CAS extensively, we turned to CAS to help find a solution. Given our success so far, we decided to use a similar approach to solve this problem too.</p><h4 name="ade5" id="ade5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">About Author</h4><figure name="cddf" id="cddf" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*sRq6kxVuhym8Mh9JCNPxqA.png" data-width="250" data-height="250" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*sRq6kxVuhym8Mh9JCNPxqA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Ajey Gore (Go-Jek CTO)</figcaption></figure><p name="4f1d" id="4f1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">With 17 years of experience in building core technology strategy across diverse domains, Ajey has helped several businesses through technology transformations @ Thoughtworks and CodeIgnition.<br>Ajey is the founder of Codeingnition and an active influencer in the technology community.</p><p name="6183" id="6183" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Stay tuned for the second and final part of this series of posts to see how we went about this.</p></div></div></section>
