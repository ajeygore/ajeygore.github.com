## Personal Journey

YourStory published my [Interview](https://yourstory.com/2017/05/techie-tuesdays-ajey-gore){:target="_blank"} in 2017. It sums up pretty well.

#### A thank you note, and little more about my life!

My life, here is my take on it. I have been super fortunate to have an amazing family, who supported me as much as they could.
My mother has worked tirelessly at both fronts to meet ends, while my brothers & sister have showered unconditional love throughout their life to me.
I have [an amazing life-partner](https://twitter.com/shraddhagore){:target="_blank"}, who stood by me for everything I did, the crazy rides of life won't be anywhere close to where I am today without her, thanks Shraddha.

And then there are amazing friends who have shaped my life, The amount of people who have helped me in life, is just endless. I have been super forunate to know them, and have them in my life.

I started my career as graphics designer for designing ads for newspapers, 
later I helped my brother with his Accounting & DTP business, selling computers in early 90s and then helping run printing business late 90s. 
Around mid 90s I got interested in programming and started learning languages, 
starting with C and later joining **National Centre for Software Technology** as student, 
then I worked at NCST as technical associate and finally working in r & d unit as staff scientist, 
mainly working on multilingual software for indian languages using Unicode. Early 2000s I joined a niche agile software consulting firm, 
**ThoughtWorks** as their first employee in India as developer. 
I joined as Developer, and went on to work with ThoughtWorks for next decade, 
I worked in multiple countries and helping various clients with solving problems. 
Primarily a programmer, but having huge interest in infrastructure and configuration management, 
in 2006 I became **head of global IT operations** for ThoughtWorks and later
became **head of techology** for ThoughtWorks India. 

Given hectic travel schedule and not able to focus on my family, and we had a second addition in our family (Welcome Raaghav)In 2012, 
I decided to take break from ThoughtWorks, after few months of break, I joined Bharati SoftBank startup, Hoppr, as **chief technology offier**, later Hoppr got acquired by [Hike Messenger](https://hike.in/){:target="_blank"}

I have always tried to do something on my own, and that list goes on

- Tried opening a screen printing press in 1990s
- Sold computers and peripherals in my town
- Helped my brother sell cellphones - It was fun.
- We ran a school
- Almost opened up catering business

So, given that, Early 2010s cloud and software deployments were two interesting domain to venture in, And in late 2012, early 2013, we, me and my few friends, decided to start another venture, a cloud automation and software deployment startup, CodeIgnition.

Later, [gojek](https://gojek.com){:target="_blank"} asked us to join them in late 2015.

#### Experience

I have been working since I was 14, professionally, I started at the age of 22, but earlier 7 years is where I learned to survive and thrive. 
So in terms of experience, lets say, I can draw, paint, code and survive.

What ever I write about software technology will be obsolete in 1.5 years and keep updating that will be tedious, I can just say that I know enough to tell you what I don't know about
life, work, software, painting and drawing.

#### Interests

Let me put it in proper Indian way - Cooking (Not singing and dancing), Writing software, Playing Chess, Squash and Some online strategy games.
