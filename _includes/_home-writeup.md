Hello & Welcome! 

This website mostly talks about software engineering and creating products with help from software and technology.

I have been writing software for more than 2 decades. And always have been curious about software engineering as craft, mostly regarding how to write "good" software. That quest hasn't been finished, instead it has just grown into more curiosity, resulting into more reading, studying and learning about it.

Software design and development is still in it's infancy. It's pretty new. Although it has exploded in the  last few years. Writing good software has been a challenge and ever evolving landscape makes it complex. Given software by nature very flexible and maliable, yet writing it in a modular, expandable and pluggable way, is a very complex process. Writing software requires us to express our intent in a very precise manner, and most of the time, we end up writing tactical solutions with no longitivity and scalability. Having tactical yet scalable and strategic yet faster development cycle is a balancing act, that every one needs to learn.

Computer languages are very structured, that means, expressing our business logic and intent, is a tough task unless
we follow certain practices.

Software design is a very creative process and over the year it has resulted in many experiments around different aspects such as design, architecture, languages and paradigms. There seems to be an explosion of trying out new ideas, new languages. We have seen paradigm specific language and even domain specific languages evolve over last 40 years.

We are now setting down in the phase of distributed computing, big data, functional programming and many more interesting ideas exteding into field of artificial intelligence - the use cases which seemed distant, now have become commodity. And this has become very creative field in last few years.

Yet, I have experienced very few organisations, putting emphasis on software engineering as craft and software engineers as craftsmen. I hope it changes over period of the time, because it's a very important to change for us to make an impactful product.

Writing code for computers is an easy task, especially when you have abundance of code samples on the internet.  The hard tasks is to write code that humans understands and the code operates
your business solutions that in turn provides frictionless product experiences to our users.

Technlogy has become essential for growth & scale of the technology backed products;
or understanding and solving complex software engineering problems related computer vision, estimation or getting consumer's intent using data, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Technology is the most effective tool to achieve the impossible.

After spending amazing, crazy and full of learning journey from 2015 t0 2020, I left _**gojek**_ and joined _**Sequoia Capital**_ to pursue my aim of "doing something for community". One of the main driving force for me was to be able to give back to startup communityby helping companies with their technology and product based challenges and also be able to learn from them to spread that knowledge to others.

If you are working on some interesting startup idea, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
