# Technology Leadership & Engineering Excellence

## About Me

With over **25 years of experience** in technology and software engineering, I've had the privilege of building, scaling, and leading engineering organizations across diverse industries and geographies. My journey spans from hands-on software development to executive technology leadership, with a consistent focus on creating impactful products and fostering engineering excellence.

Currently serving as **Operating Partner (Technology)** at **PeakXV Partners** (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA), I work with portfolio companies to solve complex technology challenges, scale engineering teams, and build sustainable technology organizations.

## Core Focus Areas

### Software Engineering as a Craft

I believe deeply in software engineering as a discipline and craft. After two decades of writing code, my curiosity about creating "good" software has only intensified. This pursuit has led me to continuously explore better methodologies, architectural patterns, and development practices.

> **"While software is inherently flexible and malleable, designing it to be modular, expandable, and maintainable requires intentional architectural thinking and disciplined engineering practices."**

### Balancing Strategy and Execution

One of the most critical challenges in modern software development is achieving the right balance between tactical delivery and strategic architecture. Organizations need systems that can evolve rapidly while maintaining scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

> **"The art lies in expressing business intent precisely through code while building systems that can adapt to changing requirements without compromising on engineering principles."**

### Technology-Driven Product Innovation

Modern products increasingly depend on sophisticated technology stacks involving distributed computing, data engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My experience spans building systems that handle massive scale while delivering exceptional user experiences.

> **"Technology serves as the most powerful enabler for achieving what once seemed impossible, transforming ambitious product visions into reality."**

## Philosophy & Approach

### Engineering Excellence

I advocate for treating software engineers as craftspeople and software engineering as a creative discipline. Too few organizations recognize this, yet it's fundamental to building products that truly make an impact.

### Human-Centric Code

While writing code for computers is straightforward, the real challenge lies in writing code that humans can understand, maintain, and evolve. This is especially critical when code embodies complex business logic that drives user experiences.

### Continuous Learning

The software engineering landscape evolves continuouslyâ€”from new programming paradigms and languages to revolutionary approaches in distributed systems and AI. Staying current while applying proven principles remains a key focus.

## Current Mission

At **PeakXV Partners**, I'm dedicated to giving back to the startup ecosystem by:

- **Advising** portfolio companies on technology strategy and architecture decisions
- **Helping** scale engineering teams and build strong engineering cultures  
- **Sharing** learnings and best practices across the startup community
- **Mentoring** technology leaders and engineering teams

This role allows me to combine my operational experience with a broader mission of nurturing the next generation of technology companies.
