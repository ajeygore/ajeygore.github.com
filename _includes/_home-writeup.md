Hello, 

This website mostly talks about software engineering and about creating software based products. 

I have been writing in software for more than 2 decades now. And have been curious about software engineering
as craft, mostly about how to write "good" software.

Software design and development is still in infancy. It's pretty new field. It has exploded in last
few year. And one of the reason is that software very flexible, yet writing it, is very rigid procss. Writing
software requires us to express our intent in a very precise manner.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
Computer languages are very structured, that means, expressing our business logic, is a tough task unless
we follow certain practices.

Software design is a very creative process and over the year it has resulted in many experiments including design, architecture,
languages, paradigms and thought processes. There seems to explosion of trying out new ideas, new languages. 
We are now setting down in the phase of distributed computing, big data, functional programming and many more
interesting ideas in the field of artificial intelligence - the use cases which seemed distant, now have become commodity.
 And this is a very creative field.

Yet, I have experienced very few places and organisation, putting emphasis on software engineering as craft and software engineers
as craftsmen. Over the period of time, it hope it changes, because it's becoming very important to change our view to make an impactful
product.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
Writing code for computers is an easy task, especially when you have abundance of code samples on the internet. The hard tasks it write code which humans understands and it operates
on business solutions that provide friction less product experience to end users.

Technology is the most effective tool to achive impossible, in terms of growth & scale of the technology backed products
or understanding and solving complex vision, estimation or assisting problems using data, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In 2020, I left _**gojek**_ and joined _**Sequoia Capital**_. One of the main driving force for me was to be able to give back to startup community
by helping companies with their technology and product based challenges and also be able to learn from them to spread that knowledge to others.

If you are working on some interesting startup idea, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
