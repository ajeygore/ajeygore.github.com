            <p class="lead">I'm a software engineer who believes technology should serve people, not the other way around.</p>
            
            <p>Born in India, I've had the privilege of living across continents‚Äîfrom Bangalore to London, Chicago to Jakarta, and now Singapore. My journey began in commerce and arts before finding my calling in software engineering. Along the way, I've worn many hats: graphics designer, computer salesman, printing press operator, and even helped run my brother's mobile phone business.</p>
            
            <p>What I've learned is this: every detour taught me something valuable about people, business, and building things that matter. I've spent the last two decades writing software, building teams, and helping organizations grow‚Äîbut at heart, I'm still that curious person who loves understanding how things work and why people do what they do.</p>
            
            <p>This page is my attempt to give you a user manual for working with me. Think of it as documentation‚Äîbecause everyone deserves to know what they're getting into. üòä</p>

        <!-- What I Do Section -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 class="section-title">What I Do</h3>
            
            <p>I'm a software engineer at heart, but my work extends far beyond code. I build teams, mentor leaders, and help organizations navigate the complexities of scaling technology and culture together.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I work as an Operating Partner - Technology at Sequoia Capital, where I collaborate with CTOs and CPOs across our portfolio companies. My role is part strategic advisor, part engineering consultant, and part storyteller‚Äîsharing lessons learned from two decades of building, breaking, and rebuilding systems and teams.</p>
            
            <p>Before Sequoia, I served as Group CTO at Gojek, where I helped scale a startup from a few engineers to over 2,000 people across multiple countries. It was simultaneously the most challenging and rewarding experience of my career‚Äîwatching something grow from serving thousands to serving millions of people daily.</p>
            
            <p>My approach is pragmatic: I prefer being the Swiss Army knife in tactical situations and an empowerment advocate in strategic ones. I've learned that the best solutions often come from the people closest to the problems, not from the corner offices.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Philosophy Section -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 class="section-title">My Philosophy</h3>
            
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                "I carry a small collection of successes and a large library of failures. The failures teach me more, and I'm happy to share them so others can avoid the same mistakes."
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>I believe in intellectual honesty above all else. My perspectives are shaped by my experiences, which means they're inherently biased and potentially incomplete. I welcome being corrected‚Äîit's how I learn and grow.</p>
            
            <p>Three principles guide my work:</p>
            
            <ul class="mb-4">
                <li><strong>People First:</strong> Technology serves people, not shareholders' quarterly reports. The best engineering decisions consider human impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace "I Don't Know":</strong> These three words have opened more doors for learning than any certification or degree ever could.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Wins:</strong> Complexity is often just poorly understood simplicity. The most elegant solutions are usually the most straightforward ones.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I'm fundamentally optimistic about people and technology's potential to make life better. But I'm also realistic about the hard work required to get there.</p>

        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 class="section-title">How to Work with Me</h3>
            
            <p>I'm a converted extrovert, which means I process information through conversation but also need time to think. I prefer direct communication‚Äîtell me what you think, disagree when you disagree, and don't worry about being diplomatic. I can separate professional discussions from personal relationships.</p>

        <!-- Work Style Section -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 class="section-title">What Drives Me</h3>
            
            <p>I'm energized by complex problems that sit at the intersection of technology, people, and business. Whether it's scaling engineering teams, designing systems architecture, or helping organizations evolve with their products‚ÄîI love challenges that don't have obvious solutions.</p>
            
            <div class="bg-light rounded-3 p-4 mb-4">
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Current Reading:</strong></p>
                <p class="mb-0">I highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"A Philosophy of Software Design"</a> by John Ousterhout. It captures much of what I believe about building software that lasts.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>My core beliefs about building things:</strong></p>
            <ul class="mb-4">
                <li><strong>Transparency over diplomacy:</strong> Clear communication prevents more problems than it creates</li>
                <li><strong>KISS principle:</strong> Simple solutions scale better and break less often‚Äîcomplexity is often just poorly understood simplicity</li>
                <li><strong>Solutions over features:</strong> I prefer working with people who solve problems rather than just ship code</li>
                <li><strong>Action over analysis:</strong> Doers who volunteer for unfamiliar challenges make the best leaders</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I believe organizations should evolve with their products. The team structure that works for a startup won't work for a scale-up, and what works at scale might kill innovation. The art is knowing when and how to change.</p>
            
            <p>At the end of the day, I'm just someone who enjoys learning, building things that matter, and working with people who care about their craft. The technology industry has given me incredible opportunities‚ÄîI try to pay it forward however I can.</p>
