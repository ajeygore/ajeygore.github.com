                <p>Software engineer turned startup CTO turned VC operating partner. I help companies not screw up their technology while they're growing too fast.</p>
                <p>Born in India, lived everywhere from London to Jakarta. Currently in Singapore, pretending to understand venture capital.</p>

                <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-3">Me in 2 Minutes</h2>
                <p><strong>What I do now:</strong> Operating Partner at PeakXV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India). I work with portfolio company CTOs on scaling engineering teams, architecture decisions, and the delicate art of not breaking everything while growing fast.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How I got here:</strong> Started as a graphics designer, sold mobile phones with my brother, worked at ThoughtWorks, founded CodeIgnition, became Group CTO at Gojek (scaled from ~50 to 2000+ engineers), then joined Sequoia.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What drives me:</strong> Building teams that ship great software without burning out. I've seen both sides—the hyper-growth chaos and the enterprise sluggishness. The sweet spot is somewhere in between.</p>
                
                <p><strong>My superpower:</strong> Asking "why" until we find the real problem. Also, I respond to phone calls almost immediately (weird, I know).</p>

                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Come with options</strong> — I love choosing between solutions rather than starting from scratch</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Embrace "I don't know"</strong> — these three words unlock better conversations</li>

                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Transparency beats diplomacy</strong> — clear communication prevents most problems</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Organizations must evolve</strong> — what works at startup scale kills enterprise innovation</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Action over analysis</strong> — the best leaders volunteer for unfamiliar challenges</li>
