                <p>I'm on a break — but still helping people and organisations create impact and magnificent outcomes. Spending time with family, advising founders selectively, and working with <strong><a href="https://helloally.ai" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none">Ally</a></strong> on mental health — a cause I care about deeply. My calendar is friendlier than it's been in years. <a href="/meetme" class="text-decoration-none">Book a conversation</a>.</p>

            <section class="mb-5">
                <h2 class="h5 mb-3" style="color: var(--heading-color);">The story so far</h2>

                <p>Most recently, I was Operating Partner (Technology) at <strong>PeakXV Partners</strong> (FKA Sequoia Capital India & SEA), working with portfolio companies on engineering culture, product-market fit, and scaling technology foundations. That chapter concluded in January 2026.</p>

                <p>Before PeakXV, I was Group CTO at <strong>Gojek</strong>, where I helped scale the engineering team from a handful of people to over 2,000 across multiple countries. And before that, I spent a decade at <strong>ThoughtWorks</strong> — starting as their first India office employee and eventually leading technology for the India region.</p>

                <p>Along the way, I co-founded <strong>CodeIgnition</strong> (acquired by Gojek), ran a startup called <strong>Hoppr</strong> (acquired by Hike), and tried my hand at everything from selling computers to running a printing press. <a href="/about" class="text-decoration-none">The longer version is here</a>.</p>
