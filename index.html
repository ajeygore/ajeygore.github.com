                As an engineer, I thought about "Code" "Deploy" "Automate" as engineering excellence, and especially automate part so that we can be lazy not to repeat same thing again again.
                but when building products, I believe much better way to put it is to ideate then implement, and finally iterate over and over, to go back to the ideation step.

                Here I write about <a href="/what">MY</a> experiences with product engineering. About creating
                products, building teams and scaling organisations.
