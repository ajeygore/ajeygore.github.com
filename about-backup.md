            <p class="lead">This is my readme file. I am Ajey Gore, and this is my manual or readme file, know me.</p>
            
            <p>I am from India. I studied commerce, arts and later software engineering.</p>
            
            <p>I have lived in Bangalore, London, Chicago, Pune, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad, Jakarta and now I live in Singapore.</p>
            
            <p>Started my career as a graphics designer, sold computers, ran a printing press, helped my elder brother in his cell phone and DTP business and finally settled writing software for most of my life.</p>
            
            <p>I learned many things along the way and met some amazing people over the years. I love to talk to people about technology, people, teams and building organizations.</p>
            
            <p>So this page is about "how to deal with me" as a person, because I fundamentally believe that everyone else is right about me and dealing with me is constant expectation mismatch and a cage fight in a very interesting way, where I might appear dogmatic and other person think that they are principled :-)</p>

        <!-- What I Do Section -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 class="section-title">What do I do?</h3>
            
            <p>I'm a Software Engineer at the core. I love building teams and working with people. I work for people and people work with me.</p>
            
            <p>I see myself as swiss knife in tactical situations and an empowerment advocate in strategic terms. I have played various roles in my life and recently at GoJek, now I work with Sequoia Capital as Technology Partner.</p>
            
            <p>In my role, I work with the CTOs and CPOs of Sequoia's portfolio companies to provide insight and expertise in building and scaling engineering, data science, product, and design functions. In crude terms, I tell them what not to do, about my mistakes and learnings.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Philosophy Section -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                I fundamentally believe that I am a package of success and have a cargo full of failures with me, I might have 1 or 2 good success stories, but most of the time I will tell one of the failures from 100s of stories and incidents, I experienced through out last 2 decades or so.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>I am sure the perspectives I am trying to put you through and context I am trying to give you are my side of stories and perception. They might be wrong - because one side of the story is never true, since it's based on human perception, but you are welcome to correct me.</p>
            
            <p>Because I learned that "Saying I don't know, and accepting those mistakes" are few of many important traits one should have apart from being empathetic, curious and ready to learn.</p>

        <!-- Communication Section -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 class="section-title">Best Way to Communicate with Me</h3>
            
            <p>I am converted extrovert, so I sometimes put perceived information through my introverted lens, that means, sometimes I see what I want to see, so I try to confirm with people on what I perceive, the way I want you to tell me what you think is walk up to me and tell me what you feel.</p>
            
            <p>I keep my professional life within the confines of office premise, that means that we can argue, agree to disagree, but still can have an amazing dinner! I don't bring official matters to any personal meetings or outings.</p>

            <p>I don't initiate one on one conversations, just because I run out of time, in turn I am perceived as one of the most difficult people to get time from, but if you really want to talk to me, just call me!</p>
            
            <p>So I'm ok with being engaged however you are comfortable. Take as long as you need to. Use many words or few. Use chat, email or call me or meet me in person. Whatever works for you. I'll adjust, and won't judge.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, I have strong opinions that I strive to hold as long as I am shown better ways, so I'm always easiest to persuade with logic and always ready to learn. I always look for traits in people who come with problem & solutions with it, always give me options to choose from and always tell their opinions on something before seeking mine.</p>

        <!-- Work Style Section -->
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h3 class="section-title">My Work Style</h3>
            
            <p>I really enjoy working on complex strategic product problems involving software engineering, design, data science or scaling. I have a strong interest in software design, team building and how they work with org design. I believe that the way product evolves over a period of time, organization should evolve as well.</p>

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong></p>
                <p class="mb-0">I have always followed John Ousterhaut and now he has a book around the same topic, please read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> by John Ousterhout.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>I prefer being reasonable and transparent. I encourage transparency in general - especially around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">communication</a>.</p>
            
            <p>I really believe in <strong>KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)</strong> principle - one my great mentors at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThoughtWorks</a> taught me. Simple is always powerful. Simple means you can always build upon it.</p>
            
            <p>I like people building solutions, not features. I have strong bias towards doers than talkers. People who step up and volunteer to solve problems that they have never done before always get my vote for leadership roles.</p>
